 Introduction : 

** Background - Current Situation

With the proliferation of technology and the expansion of the internet around the world, changes are also being felt in education and learning. Today, the learning experience is not only presented in a physical environment - in a classroom or college, but also in a digital environment, which serves as an interactive platform for remote learning.

The educational market is expanding and searching for quality solutions and tools for remote learning. Colleges and academic institutions face the challenge of upgrading and improving the student learning process through the need to provide a quality learning experience in the virtual world.

The establishment of the site arises from the need to create a unique opportunity to enhance the student's experience, allowing much greater accessibility to students to create an active and advanced interactive learning environment.


** The Need for Implementation Development: 

The need for implementation development arises from the growth of autonomous learning among students across the country and the world, and the increasing use and predominance of digital platforms for independent learning.

This implementation allows students to access videos, summaries, and tools that provide deep understanding of the material. Additionally, it enables personal knowledge testing through questions and interactive exercises. Through this implementation, there is a focus on the student's individual learning experience, which can be tailored to personal needs, granting students a rich and varied presentation of knowledge.

Creating a summary and vision video will help improve the learning experience for students and allow them to focus on the overall material. The summaries allow students to review the critical points without missing important information. The vision provides an additional focus on management, allowing students to remember the material in the long run, focusing on active participation. This allows lecturers to better understand and adapt the programs to the students' needs. Thus, the summaries and visions enrich the learning experience and contribute to student success.
